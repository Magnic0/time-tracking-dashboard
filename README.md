# Frontend Mentor - Time tracking dashboard

This Repo is a study Repo, created for my solution of the [Time Tracking Dashboard Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/time-tracking-dashboard-UIQ7167Jw) from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home).

## How it was made

This is a challenge that I've took some time to complete, more than I actually needed to do so. Several events occurred while I was developing it and this took me a lot of this time.

### Requeriments

For the challenge to be accepted finished, it needs to follow some requeriments. They are:


- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size;
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page;
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats.


### Technologies

The technologies I've used to develop it are:

- HTML;
- Sass;
- JavaScript (without any framework).

This project is a learning experience that I've used to start developing with the **DOM**, so furthermore I can get to use some frontend framework (like ReactJS, Vue or Angular).

## Forking it

If you want to fork it and create your own project using it as a base one, be free to do it right now!

Unfortunately, I won't be accepting pull requests in this repo because it need to be an demonstration of my work only.

### Compiling

In order to make the styles work, you will need to compile all the Sass files into the `dist`. You can make it with the compiler you want, I personally like to use the [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass) Extension, avaliable in VSCode.

But you can try to learn about the [`npm compile-sass`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compile-sass) feature from NodeJS.
